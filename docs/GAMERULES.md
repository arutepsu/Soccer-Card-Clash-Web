## ⚽ Game Rules

- 🔄 Players alternate roles each round.
- 🃏 The **attacker** always uses the last card(s) in hand.
- 🛡️ The **defender** does not act — only endures the attack.
- 🆚 Cards are compared — the stronger card wins.
- ⚠️ Exception: 2 can beat an Ace to maintain fairness.
- 🚫 You can't attack the goalkeeper until all defenders are defeated.
- 🥅 Beating the goalkeeper scores a goal and switches roles.

## 🗡️ Attack Types

### 🔹 Single Attack
- Uses the **last card** in the attacker’s hand.

### 🔸 Double Attack
- Uses the **last two cards** in the attacker’s hand.

---

## 🎯 Attack Outcomes

### ✅ Success
- Beaten defender(s) are added to the end of the attacker's hand.
- The attacker continues their turn.

### ❌ Failure
- Roles switch — the defender becomes the new attacker.

### 🤝 Tie
- The next-to-last cards are compared.
- The stronger pair wins the round.

## 💥 Boosting

- The attacker can **boost** their own defenders or **goalkeeper**.
- Boosting increases card strength based on the boosting card's value:

| Boost Card | Boost Value |
|------------|-------------|
| Two        | +6          |
| Three      | +5          |
| Four       | +5          |
| Five       | +4          |
| Six        | +4          |
| Seven      | +3          |
| Eight      | +3          |
| Nine       | +2          |
| Ten        | +2          |
| Jack       | +1          |
| Queen      | +1          |
| King       | +1          |
| Ace        | +0          |

- ⚠️ Boosting counts as **one action** per turn.
- ❗ If no actions remain, boosting is disabled and a warning appears.
- 🔁 Whenever a boosted card is moved to a player's hand (whether attacker or defender), its original value is restored.

---

## 🔄 Swap Mechanics

### 🔁 Regular Swap
- Select a card from your hand.
- Swap it with the **last card** in your hand.

### 🔃 Reverse Swap
- Instantly **reverses the entire hand order**.

### 📌 Notes on Actions
- Every swap (regular or reverse) **consumes one action**.
- When all actions are used up, no further actions are allowed for that turn.

---

### 🧮 Action Limit

Each turn comes with a limited number of actions. 
Once you've used all your actions, you won’t be able to perform any more until the next turn.

##### 📝 Actions that count toward the limit:

* 🔄 Regular Swap
* 
* 🔁 Reverse Swap
* 
* ⚡ Defender Boost
* 
* ⚡ Goalkeeper Boost
* 
* ⚔️ Double Attack

###### ⛔ Once the limit is reached, further actions are blocked for that turn.
